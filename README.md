# Frontend Mentor - Todo app

Challenge:  https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution for the Room Homepage challenge in Frontend Mentor using ReactJs

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size âœ…
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page âœ…
- Add new todos to the list âœ…
- Mark todos as complete âœ…
- Delete todos from the list âœ…
- Filter by all/active/complete todos âœ…
- Clear all completed todos âœ…
- Toggle light and dark mode âœ…
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list âœ…
